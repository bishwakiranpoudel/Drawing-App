# Drawing App with Pencil and Paint Bucket Tools

This is a simple drawing application implemented in Python using the `tkinter` library for GUI and the `PIL` (Pillow) library for image manipulation. The app allows users to create drawings using both a pencil tool for freehand drawing and a paint bucket tool for filling regions with colors.

## Features

- Pencil tool for drawing freehand lines.
- Paint bucket tool for filling connected regions with colors.
- Color selection using a color picker dialog.
- Option to save drawings as PNG images.
